Problem Overview:
You are given a digital screen with 12 numerical displays arranged in a straight line, grouped into three segments of four digits each. The numbers on these displays change randomly between 0 to 9 at an unpredictable rate. Your task is to build a real-time data capturing and transmission system that records and updates this data on a remote server and a live database continuously.
